            The automated health check detected issues with annotation loading.

            **Possible causes:**
            - AnnoRepo service is down or unreachable
            - API routes are timing out
            - Linking annotations loading before base annotations
            - Data integrity issues

            **Action required:** Review the workflow logs and test the viewer manually.
